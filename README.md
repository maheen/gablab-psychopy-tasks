# gablab-psychopy-tasks
While working at the [Gabrieli lab](http://gablab.mit.edu/) at MIT, I programmed several tasks for brain imaging and behavioral experiments. I used open-source software called [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/), which provides tools for building psychological experiments in Python.

These tasks will not run in their current form, as the experimental stimuli they draw on are not provided here and I no longer have access to them.
